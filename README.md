Cross  - Dialogue, SFX, BGM

This update added dialog boxes that pop up when the player find the abilities that are found around the world. Dialog boxes also pop up when the player discovers a new item to explain what they do. Sound effects and music were also added to the game. Sound effects are from Kirby Super Star for the SNES and the background music is the Boss battle theme from Megaman X for the SNES.

When the player interacts with an orb for the first time the game will display an information tab that will explain what the orb does and what ability the player has gained. When the player does a certain action sound effects play, when an enemy targets the player or when an enemy is hit by a player projectile they also make a sound that makes the player more aware of what is happening.
